# DevBookmarks 📂

## ✨ Introduction

While browsing the internet, I often come across useful websites, interesting libraries, component catalogs, icons, SVGs, and many other development resources. But here’s the problem:

- If I save them in my browser's bookmarks, it becomes a mess.
- Sometimes I lose them among too many saved links.
- Other times, I tell myself, “I’ll check this later,” but when “later” comes, I don’t remember where I saw it.
- And if I do remember, I have no idea how to find it quickly.

After experiencing this issue many times, I decided to create **this GitHub repository**. It’s a space where I can store, categorize, and organize all these useful links in one place. GitHub is a versatile tool with version control and easy access, making it the best option to keep these resources well-organized.

## 🔄 Repository Organization

Each section of this repository is divided into independent Markdown files within structured folders. This allows me to quickly access what I need without digging through a cluttered list of links.

**Important:** The purpose of this repository **is not** to store links to official documentation for well-known technologies like Angular, React, Vue, etc. Those are easy to find with a quick search. Instead, this repository focuses on **lesser-known libraries and tools**, the kind that are truly useful but not widely visible unless you research extensively.

Here’s the structure I’ve defined:
